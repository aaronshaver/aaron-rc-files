## Usage

For the easiest experience, symlink the repo files to your home directory, e.g.:

    ln -s code/nix-config-files/.vim/ .

(do that in your home directory)

This way you'll only have to update your files in one place, as opposed to having  to copy them to the repo directory, or having to have a Git repo initialied for your home directory (probably undesirable).
